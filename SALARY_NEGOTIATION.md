## What is your salary expectation?

### Examples
> So you know what you need, how badly you need it, what you're willing to pay for it?

> You know I really don't know. I don't have a number in mind right now. I'd like to think about the value that I can add to this firm and this team. I'm excited for this opportunity based on what I know about it. And I can't wait to learn more about it and continue talking to people in the interview process.

> You know I'm really not comfortable sharing my current salary and what my employer pays people that do the kind of work that I do, and I'd rather focus on the value that I can add in this position. And I'm really looking forward to this move being a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation and I can't wait to talk about the position and the opportunity that's ahead of me.

> I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skillset and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.

> Before I give you a number, I'd like to understand how you compensate employees and how this job fits into your compensation structure. I'm curious to know the salary grade for this position, the salary range and midpoint for that grade, and where that grade fits into your compensation system? That will give me a better idea of how this position fits into your structure and my career plans.

> Before I give you a number, I'd like to understand more about company, the work environment, the requirements of the job, and other important considerations like the opportunity for growth. Then, I'll have a better idea what an appropriate salary would be.

> I need to understand and evaluate the total compensation package before I give you a salary number. Could you share the standard benefits you provide?

> Thank you for that question. On this stage let us check first that we are a great fit for each other and we could circle back to that questions later.

> Thank you for that question. Hey, I'm just an engineer, I'm sure you know the market better than me so I trust you to evaluate my skill set first and if we are a great fit to circle back to that topic.

> Listen, you need somebody to do this job. I'm somebody who can do that job. Let me describe to you how well I can do that job and how well I understand what your needs are. And then we can talk about what's the appropriate price for you to pay me to do that job. And we can collaborate to find something that we both feel is good.

> I don't have one. Look, I know you want to be fair. You have salary ranges for employees with a given skillset and responsibility, right? I don't want to be paid less than everybody else. I don't want to be paid more than everybody else. Just give me something in the middle.

## They offer a lower salary

> Thank you, my current salary rate is higher, but you could always call me back at any time if you still think we are a great fit for each other.

> Hello, thanks for reaching me out!  
The offer you're sharing with me sounds very interesting, but my salary expectations are higher.  
Thanks for sharing and let's keep in touch for a next opportunity!  
Have a great day

> 🇪🇸 🇨🇴 Hola, gracias por compartir! 
Realmente el rango salarial está por debajo de mis expectativas, de todas formas gracias por contactarme y espero que podamos seguir en contacto para una próxima oportunidad! 
Feliz día 🙂

## They offer an equal salary

> Thank you, I think we are on the same page in terms of salary ranges but let us circle back to that conversation later after we will check how good is our mutual fit.

## They ask for a call first

> Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. As a software engineer I'm sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn. It is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I'm thankful for it.  
It does however mean that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.  
I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to level set around the level of seniority that you're looking for.  
Can you send along the company name, a job description and, total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to?  
While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.
In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.  
Thanks again for reaching out!  
I look forward to hearing from you.

> Hello, hope you're doing well.  
Sounds interesting, can you share the description of this job opportunity please? And can you tell me about the salary range you have budgeted for this role?  
Thanks for sharing!

> 🇪🇸 🇨🇴 En el momento me están contactando de varias partes, por lo tanto quisiera saber de inicio cuál es el rango salarial presupuestado para este rol, como sería el tipo de contrato y que beneficios/perks ofrecen ustedes?
Gracias por compartir!

## They don't offer a salary range

> **I need a number to fill a form:** Just put a dollar so we could circle back to that later.

> I am seeking a base pay of $XX,XXX **(HIGHER END OF YOUR RANGE)**, but I can be flexible depending on the benefits and any incentives you may offer, please let me know if that salary range works for you.

> Based on my research and the information you have provided, I believe that a salary in the range of $XX,XXX to $XX,XXX with [# of weeks of] paid vacation, [other benefits important to you which have been stated as included], and your other benefits would be appropriate.

> 🇪🇸 🇨🇴 Hola! entiendo completamente, actualmente mi aspiración salarial es de $XXXXXX USD en adelante **(El valor más alto de tu rango)**, pero soy flexible dependiendo de los beneficios que ustedes ofrezcan, déjame saber si este rango salarial está bien para ustedes.


## “What is your current salary?”
- [It's a red flag](https://dev.to/jmfayard/what-is-your-current-salary-is-a-red-flag-that-you-don-t-want-to-work-here-3aji)

### Examples
> Oh, yeah, I was going to ask you, do you know the budget for the role?

> You guys know the market and are good at what you do, I trust you to make a great offer if you're interested.

> I'm not prepared to discuss numbers yet, but if we each decide that we're a good fit, I'm sure we'll find something we are happy with.

> Hello, XYZ. Thanks for reaching out. This sounds like an interesting opportunity, but I'd like to be respectful of your time. May I ask about the salary (range is fine) and benefits plan beforehand?

> Why is it relevant? ... Ah, I see. Thanks for the clarification. Look, I want to be transparent: If you were to make me an offer, it's unlikely I would accept it. Your company isn’t a great fit for me at this time. So I don't want to waste more of your time. But if you wind up brushing up on your interviewing process and making improvements, feel free to reach out to me again for consideration **(10x DEVELOPER)**

> **I am unable to provide my current salary**: As I am sure you understand, my employer considers employee salaries to be confidential, and access to this information is limited to management inside our organization. So, I am unable to share it with you. However, if you share the salary level and range for this position, I can confirm that my salary is within that range or not. I'm sure you'll understand me cause if we would work together and will have any private conversations with you the company could be sure 'll never disclose it as well.

> I don't think that my current salary is relevant, but if you must have that information, I will provide it after you share the salary level and range for this job.

> I **will** share my salary expectations with you, and we can see if it fits into your salary range for this position.

> I have done my initial homework, and salary information on the Internet indicates I’m in the range. For now we should assume that salary won’t be an issue.  Plus, I need to understand the full extent of the opportunity and the benefits you provide to employees plus what the salary range is for this role.

> Sharing my current salary is inappropriate for me. I'm expecting to be compensated conmesurately with my experience and the role that I’ll have at this company.

Understand that "your mileage may vary." If the employer isn’t very interested (or has many other people they could hire), they probably won’t do much negotiation. If they are very interested in you, they will negotiate. Many employers expect to negotiate starting salaries. However, some do not want to negotiate and may even withdraw a job offer if pressed for a higher starting salary.

## They can't move forward

> Thanks for letting me know, I understand! Thanks for sharing and let's keep in touch!
